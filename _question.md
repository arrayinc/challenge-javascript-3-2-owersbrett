# CHALLENGE 2

While we’re on the subject of silly songs, another old standby is “This Old Man,” for which the first verse is:

> This old man, he played 1.
> He played knick-knack on my thumb. With a knick-knack, paddy-whack, Give your dog a bone.
> This old man came rolling home.

Each subsequent verse is the same, except for the number and the rhyming word at the end of the second line, which get replaced as follows:
2—shoe 3—knee 4—door
5—hive 6—sticks 7—heaven
8—pate 9—spine 10—shin
